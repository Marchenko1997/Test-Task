## 🚌 Camper Rent Application

## ✏️ Overview

This project was developed as a technical task for a corporate client. It is a web application designed for a business specializing in camper rentals.

The application is structured into three primary sections:

- `Home Page` This provides a general overview of the services offered by the company.
- `Catalog Page` A detailed catalog of campers available for rent, featuring filtering capabilities based on location, equipment, and type.
- `Favorites Page` A compilation of advertisements that users have marked as favorites.

# 📍Features

-Ad Card: Users have the ability to add or remove ads from their favorites and view detailed camper information within a modal window.

-Pagination: The application displays four ads per page, with a "Load More" button to access additional listings.

-Persistent Favorites: Favorite ads are stored in local storage, ensuring they remain saved even after a page refresh.

-Filtering: Users can refine their search by filtering campers based on location, equipment, and type.
